        <h3> & I am a drama addict</h3>
        <p> Iâ€™ve been watching Korean drama for 10 years and drama from all across Asia for a couple years now.</p>

        <p>I wanted to put Filipino, Thai, Taiwanese, Japanese, Vietnamese and Chinese dramas in here as well but
            because i already watched too many Korean ones, that would have been way too much dramas to review so tell
            me if you want the other one in the future.</p>
